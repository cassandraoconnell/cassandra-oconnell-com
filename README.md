# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

### This is the codebase for my personal site, [cassandraoconnell.com](https://www.cassandraoconnell.com/). It's built using NextJS, React, and MongoDB. Excessive? Definitely! A lot of fun to build? You bet!

In a real-world scenario, I'd have just built this site using plain ol' HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The stack I'm using here is a bit much for what the site is, but I wanted to use my site code as a showcase of how I write front end applications.

Enjoy!
